# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added a Russian localization of the client interface, with a language toggle beside the theme toggle that remembers the visitor's choice and defaults to the browser language, plus a protected-terminology glossary with automated checks so Kill Team rules terms are never translated.
- Updated Dragon Masters logo to a transparent 256x256 asset and placed Dragon Masters last in challenge tracks.
- Added Dragon Masters as a selectable Kill Team, challenge team, and stats team with logo.
- Added admin tools to view active games, force-confirm submitted results, and delete active/pending games.
- Added admin password reset from player profiles with a generated temporary password.
- Rebuilt the backend into focused modules: HTTP layer, domain rules, and SQL repositories.
- Replaced whole-database read-modify-write with transactional per-row SQL, fixing lost updates when two players acted at the same time.
- Moved to versioned database migrations recorded in `schema_migrations`.
- Removed the JSON storage fallback; PostgreSQL is now required. Use `scripts/import-json-db.js` to migrate existing JSON data.
- Unified Kill Team names into one canonical registry and migrated stored results and challenge credits.
- Stopped returning Telegram contacts and register nicknames to anonymous callers on the leaderboard.
- Added security headers, the `Secure` cookie flag in production, and rate limiting on sign-in and registration.
